Zearch is a project aimed at building Google 2.0 using the powerful combination of Tailwind CSS and Next.js. It incorporates responsive design, server-side rendering (SSR) with React, and pagination. By leveraging the latest features of Tailwind CSS, including the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler, Zearch offers a modern and efficient user experience.

### Project Features
* **Responsive Design:** Zearch is designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. The user interface adapts dynamically to ensure optimal usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Server-side Rendering (SSR) with React:** By utilizing Next.js, Zearch benefits from server-side rendering, which improves performance and enables search results to be pre-rendered on the server before being sent to the client. This ensures faster page loading and improved search engine optimization (SEO).
* **Pagination:** Zearch incorporates pagination to enhance usability and make it easier for users to navigate through search results. With the ability to display a limited number of results per page, users can quickly find the information they need.

### Technologies Used
* **Tailwind CSS:** Zearch utilizes Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable utility-first CSS framework. With its intuitive class-based approach, Tailwind CSS enables rapid development and easy customization of styles.
* **Next.js:** Next.js is a popular React framework that enhances React applications with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing. It provides an efficient development experience while ensuring fast performance and optimal SEO.
